To integrate data collection with RabbitMQ, you'll need to install the pika library, which provides a Python interface for RabbitMQ. 

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your script to publish the pressure data to RabbitMQ:

## Install pika Library:
Ensure you have pika installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
```
pip install pika
```
## Modify the Script:
Modify the existing script to publish the pressure data to RabbitMQ:
```
sensor_data_collector.py
```
